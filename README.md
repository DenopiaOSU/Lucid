What is guweb?
------

guweb is the front-facing appearance of the osu! server protocol, [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag)!
Using native async/await syntax written on top of [Quart](https://github.com/pgjones/quart) and
[cmyui's multipurpose library](https://github.com/cmyui/cmyui_pkg), guweb achieves flexability, cleanliness,
and efficiency not seen in other frontend implementations - all while maintaining the simplicity of Python.
